ðŸ“§ Email Queue Monitor

A simple React application created to streamline my work routine.
I frequently need to monitor an email queue that an API provides in HTML format.
Initially, I had to manually refresh the page to check for updates, which was inefficient.

To solve this, I developed this application, which automatically makes a request to the API 
every 15 seconds and updates the screen with the latest queue status. This small automation 
significantly improved my workflow, reducing manual effort and ensuring I never forget to refresh the page.
